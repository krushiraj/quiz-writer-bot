# quiz-writer-bot
A bot written in python that writes quizzes which are required for online course completion.

-> Running `quiz_bot.py` will start the bot.

-> I had few ideas to avoid such bots if I had a site which hosts online test, one of the efficient way that I felt was included with demo in `bot-avoiding-workarounds` folder.
